# IrisExplorer
# Iris Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview

This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic **Iris dataset**. The primary objective is to analyze and visualize the distribution and relationships among various Iris species based on their morphological features — sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This analysis helps in understanding the distinguishing characteristics of each species.

## Dataset Description

The **Iris dataset** consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers, categorized into three species:

- *Iris-setosa*
- *Iris-versicolor*
- *Iris-virginica*

Each sample includes the following measurements (in centimeters):

- SepalLengthCm
- SepalWidthCm
- PetalLengthCm
- PetalWidthCm

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** — Core programming language
- **NumPy** — Numerical computing and array operations
- **Pandas** — Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** — Plotting and visualization
- **Seaborn** — Statistical data visualization built on Matplotlib
- **SciPy** — Advanced scientific and statistical computations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy
